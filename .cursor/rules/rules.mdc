Check the last few exchanges in the cursor conversations and last few commits and update these rule files as needed:
- [project_context.mdc](mdc:.cursor/project_context.mdc)
- [backend.mdc](mdc:.cursor/backend.mdc)
- [frontend.mdc](mdc:.cursor/frontend.mdc)

Rules are not changelog: 
- It should not look like "fixed this", "updated that", etc.
- It should look like rules: "be on left side while driving", "be on right while walking", etc.
- It can also describe the state of things: "backend contains all backend logic and APIs", etc.
- You can safely follow the content already found in the above files.
- Be general enough to apply to even new cases of the same pattern, but be specific enough to be precise and useful. Strike a balance.
- Missing an unimportant looking item is fine if you are not sure. But dont skip substantial, important ones.
- While updating, make sure you are not adding the same point again, even if it is worded differently.
- Also remove/update any parts that that got removed/updated.
- Don't use markety, vague, fluffy language
- Go for simple, intuitive, practical language. Yet be precise and accurate.
- For example, "admin data management" is a bit vague whereas "data can be imported/exported/deleted in settings page" is precise. 
- But use this smartly - sometimes being abstract is still clear.
- Organize content cleanly. 
- Dont repeat same info unnecessarily, even if worded differently.
- Confirm before updating.

For commits, to understand the commits not analyzed for rules check this (and also maintain):
Checked till commit: a959b5f
if the above is a placeholder, go for last 10 commits
the above is the only thing to update in this rule file - [rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/rules.mdc)
