- When possible follow best practices.
- Go for a balance of clean, simple, eay to understand, readable, modular, maintainable, extensible while giving code.
- Don't over-engineer.
- Encourage to break down work into sensible chunks and go systematically.
- Dont give very long responses unless absolutely required.
- Be concise, use practical and intuitive language.
- Consider the task at hand and the general direction to synthesize the most helpful response.
- Before doing dangerous things(eg: drop db, etc.) ask for approval.
- When you add new code, remove old code/file if no longer required.
- Prefer using existing components/libraries (e.g., Shoelace) over building custom ones, to avoid reinventing the wheel.
- on significant changes like add/modify/remove features/tools/endpoints/libraries/files/folders update the project_context.mdc file in the approprate place
