Project context for developers

vision
- modular, minimal projects and tasks management app
- projects can have tasks, tasks can also exist independently
- clean, maintainable, extensible codebase

features
- create/read/update/delete projects
- create/read/update/delete tasks (standalone or under projects)
- mark tasks as done, collapse done tasks
- modern UI with Shoelace, Vite
- backend API with FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- DB migrations with Alembic
- Dockerized DB for local dev

main building blocks
- backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, asyncpg, Alembic, Pydantic, uv, Docker, python-dotenv
- frontend: Vite, Shoelace, Node.js, npm
- database: PostgreSQL

api endpoints
- /api/projects/ [GET, POST] list/create projects
- /api/projects/{project_id} [GET, PUT, DELETE] get/update/delete project
- /api/projects/{project_id}/tasks [GET, POST] list/create tasks for project
- /api/tasks/ [GET, POST] list/create standalone tasks
- /api/tasks/{task_id} [GET, PUT, DELETE] get/update/delete task

models/schemas
- Project: id, name, description, created_at, updated_at, tasks
- Task: id, title, description, completed, created_at, updated_at, project_id
- Pydantic schemas mirror models for validation and API

folder structure
- backend/
  - app/
    - api/ (endpoints, routers)
    - crud/ (CRUD logic)
    - models/ (SQLAlchemy models)
    - schemas/ (Pydantic schemas)
    - database.py (DB connection)
    - main.py (FastAPI app)
  - alembic/ (migrations)
  - docker-compose.yml, docker.env, sample.env, pyproject.toml
- frontend/
  - pages/ (projects.js/html, tasks.js/html, project.js/html)
  - main.js, index.html, package.json

notes
- backend runs locally, DB in Docker
- all dependencies managed with uv (backend) and npm (frontend)
- use Shoelace components for UI, don't reinvent the wheel
- see backend/README.md and frontend/README.md for setup and dev commands
